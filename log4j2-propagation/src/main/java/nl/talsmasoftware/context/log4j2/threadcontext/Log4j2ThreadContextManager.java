/**
 * Manager to propagate the Log4j 2 {@link ThreadContext} data from one thread to another.
 * <p>
 * Calling {@link #clear()} will clear the {@code ThreadContext} data of the current thread.<br>
 * Methods of this manager may have no effect when the {@code ThreadContext} has been disabled
 * (see <a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/thread-context.html#Configuration">Log4j 2 manual</a>).
 * <p>
 * Initializing a new context through {@link #initializeNewContext(Log4j2ThreadContextSnapshot)} will
 * add the context data on top of the existing one, if any: {@code ThreadContext} stack values
 * are pushed on top of the existing stack; map entries are added to the existing map, only
 * replacing existing ones in case of a map key conflict.<br>
 * Closing a context returned from {@link #initializeNewContext(Log4j2ThreadContextSnapshot)} will reset
 * the {@code ThreadContext} to the values it had before the context was created.<br>
 * This means that closing nested contexts out-of-order will probably result in an undesirable state.<br>
 * It is therefore strongly advised to use Java's {@code try-with-resources} statement to ensure proper
 * closing when nesting {@code ThreadContext} contexts.
 * <p>
 * This manager and the contexts it creates are not suited to create {@code ThreadContext} 'scopes'
 * within the same thread. Log4j 2's {@link CloseableThreadContext} should be used for that instead.
 * <p>
 * Log4j 2 supports making {@code ThreadContext} inheritable, i.e. to have it use
 * {@link InheritableThreadLocal}. In some cases this might solve the problem of propagating
 * context from one thread to another. However in all cases where threads are reused (such
 * as thread pool executors) this will not work. It is therefore recommended to always
 * prefer using this library to cover all use cases.
 * <p>
 * As with all manager implementations of this library there is usually no need to directly
 * interact with the manager classes. Instead Java's {@code ServiceLoader} makes sure they
 * are loaded as services. If an instance of this class is needed nonetheless it can be obtained
 * through the {@link #provider()} method.
 *
 * @see <a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/thread-context.html">Log4j 2 Thread Context manual</a>
