/**
 * Manager to propagate the SLF4J {@link MDC} content from one thread to another.
 * <p>
 * As {@link MDC} already manages its own thread-local state,
 * getting the active context is 100% delegated to the MDC.<br>
 * This means that closing the resulting context from {@link #getActiveContext()} will have no side-effects,
 * as it is not ours to manage.
 * <p>
 * Closing a context returned form {@link #initializeNewContext(Map)} <strong>will</strong> reset the MDC
 * to the values it had before the context was created.<br>
 * This means that closing nested contexts out-of-order will probably result in an undesirable state.<br>
 * It is therefore strongly advised to use Java's {@code try-with-resources} mechanism to ensure proper
 * closing when nesting new MDC contexts.
