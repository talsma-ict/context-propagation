/**
 * Package protected adapter from {@link Callable} to {@link Runnable} ignoring any specified results.
 * <p>
 * Normally it is a bad idea to ignore results; therefore this adapter class is limited to package-protected visibility.
 * It is used by the {@link CallMappingExecutorService} to re-use the {@link Callable} mapping functionality for mapping
 * {@link Runnable} objects as well. In that case, the {@Callable} being converted was already originally a
 * {@link Runnable} object, and this converter merely 'converts it back'.
 * Therefore the ignored result -in this particular usecase- actually is irrelevant indeed.
