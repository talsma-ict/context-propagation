/**
 * Package for {@code ThreadLocal} specific classes.
 *
 * <h2>{@linkplain nl.talsmasoftware.context.threadlocal.AbstractThreadLocalContext}</h2>
 * <p>
 * Base class for all our own context implementations.<br>
 * It features:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Nesting; the previously active context is remembered when activating a new one,
 * so it can be restored after the new context ends.
 * <li>Predictable behaviour when used in a wrong way. Out-of-order closing can happen and will
 * result in 'skipping' an already closed context as the currently active context.
 * Closing from a different thread than where the context was created is wrong, however the
 * AbstractThreadLocalContext will deal with it.
 * </ul>
